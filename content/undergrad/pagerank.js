      <h2> The Problem </h2>
      Freshers coming to the college have know idea about the do and don't of the college. They are mostly unaware of the important and small things about the campus. Seniors are not able to pass on their legacy to the juniors because of the limited permitted interaction between the jumiors and seniors.
      <h2> The Solution </h2>
      The main focus in this project is on critical evaluation of Pagerank algorithm used by Google search engine. Page ranking is an important component for information retrieval system. 
      It is used to measure the importance and behavior of web pages. We did implement The actual Page Rank Algorithm by Sergey Bin and Larry Page. 
      We also added features for the font and psotion of link on the page which helped in getting more efficient results
