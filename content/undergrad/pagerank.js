      <h2> The Problem </h2>
      The Problem is to understand the working of Page Ranking algorithm for search engines and implement it using real time data for any seed url.
      <h2> The Solution </h2>
      The main focus in this project is on critical evaluation of Pagerank algorithm used by Google search engine. Page ranking is an important component for information retrieval system. 
      It is used to measure the importance and behavior of web pages. We did implement The actual Page Rank Algorithm by Sergey Bin and Larry Page. 
      We also added features for the font and psotion of link on the page which helped in getting more efficient results
