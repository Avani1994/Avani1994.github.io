      <h2> The Problem </h2>
      Freshers coming to the college have know idea about the do and don't of the college. They are mostly unaware of the important and small things about the campus. Seniors are not able to pass on their legacy to the juniors because of the limited permitted interaction between the jumiors and seniors.
      <h2> The Solution </h2>
      A website was made where blogs could be added dynamically and the moderators can look over the contents of the blog and decide if they want to publish it or not.
      The backend was written in PHP and Laravel framework was used. The site is live at http://glug.nith.ac.in/freshman/
      The repository is can be found <a href='https://github.com/Nithmr/FreshmanGuide'> here </a>
