      <h2> The Problem </h2>
      Classification of Autistic and Control Patients
      <h2> The Solution </h2>
      I am currently working as Research Assistant at Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute at University of Utah under Professor Bei Wang Phillips.
      My work here is to apply Machine Learning and Computational Topology Techniques on medical data .
      The data is basically from different hospitals all over USA (UCLA Medical Hospital, Utah Medical Hospital) which contains time series information of brain of different subjects. We need to classify those brain images as healthy (control) / unhealthy (autistic).
      For this we are using computational Topology to extract important features because topology cares about underlying shape of data.
      Then we are using Machine Learning algorithms over it.
