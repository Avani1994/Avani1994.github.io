        Abstract: Recently, techniques from topological data analysis have been applied
        in various scientific domains ranging from brain imaging to sensor
        networks. In this thesis, we apply topological techniques in signal processing
        to study core body temperatures of mice. We focus on the exploration of 
        biological events in a mouse model, in particular, pregnancies and jet lag. By 
        combining signal processing techniques with cohomology parameterization, 
        we create intuitive and informative visual profiles encoding periodic variations 
        in mice temperature data. Using such visual profiles, we detect and separate 
        successful pregnancies and pregnancy-like events. We further study the effect 
        of jet lag on mice by clustering them into subcategories based on their 
        topologically induced visual profiles. Jet lag has been shown to arise from critical 
        biological factors such as travel, depression, liver cancer, and Alzheimer's 
        disease. Our techniques have the potential to lead to new research directions in 
        biology that investigate individual-level responses and variabilities in jet-lagged mice.
