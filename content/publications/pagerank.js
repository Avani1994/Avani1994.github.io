      Abstract:
      Page ranking is an important component for information retrieval system. It is used to measure the 
    importance and behavior of web pages. This paper reviews the basic page ranking algorithms being used in different search engines. 
    The main focus is on critical evaluation of Pagerank algorithm used by Google search engine. As pointed out by Sergey Brin 
    and Larry Page, the existing Pagerank algorithm used by Google search engine has no provision of link visibility and link position. 
    In this paper, we propose a new algorithm which considers the factors of link visibility and link position to calculate the page rank. 
    The results have been studied for our proposed algorithm and compared with the basic existing algorithm. 
    Keywordsâ€” Pagerank; Visibility; Position; Search Engine. <a href='http://ijaecs.iraj.in/paper_detail.php?paper_id=4417' target="_blank"> View Paper </a>
